# Weekly progress journal

## Week 1
1. General
    - Background information gathering
    - Runge Kutta 4th order implementation
    - Numba implementation
        - Significant improvement in computation speed
</br>
</br>
2. Review (w.r.t) original plan
    - x
</br>
</br>
3. Things that need improvement
    - Electron implementation
        - Electron behaviour is not as expected, spiral forming not always present.
    - Jim - Install new GUI, current one is not working correctly for 3D plotting

4. Summary
    - We chose to neglect relativity. The initial speeds are not within 1/10 the velocity of the speed of light, thus relativity can be neglected (might change in the future).
    - Alpha particles move as expected, starting with a low velocity, spiral forming is present. These are shown in figure xxxxx.

    - For electrons, the movement is as following:

    - However, we expect the same behaviour spiraling as alpha particles. However, this is not present. Currently, we have no fix for these problems. This will be later adressed.
