Test #1 (basic)
0.3	167
0.4	251
0.5	290
0.6	290
0.7	257

Test #2 (optimization 1)
between 0.5 & 0.6
0.550	275
0.525	287
0.575	285

Test #3 (optimization 2)
between 0.48 and 0.62
0.48	291
0.52	279
0.54	268
0.56	283
0.58	287
0.62	277

Test #4 (optimization 3)
around 0.48 and around 0.57
0.46	276
0.47	279
0.49	274
0.51	284
0.495	283
0.485	283
0.475	285
0.57	277

Winner: 0.48
Conclusion: There seem to be 2 optimal solutions, this is probably due to the different poles attracting more particles for each solution.
