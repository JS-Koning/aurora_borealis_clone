# Project 3

Simulation of Aurora Borealis

This program consists of three-parts:
- Particle movement simulation
    - Numpyfied
    - Numbafied
    - Supports multi-threading
    - Uses Runge-Kutta 4 (Euler algorithm)
    - Simplified magnetic field
    - No two-way interaction between magnetic field and (beam of) particles for simplification
    - Saves compressed data
    - Possibility to simulate particle trajectories entering polar cusp(s) and the Van Allen radiation belt(s)
- Particle absorption simulation
    - Uses particle simulation data
    - Filters simulation data to find relevant particles only
    - Alters trajectories to allow absorption of particles between 1.01 * R_Earth and 1.1 * R_Earth (which is ~64 km to ~640 km)
- Data analysis and data results
    - Plots
    - Animations
    - Qualitative and quantitative analysis of results

This project is the final project of Computational Physics which is a course given for the Master's Degree for Applied Physics at Delft University of Technology. Our final project is a physics-related problem; which can be used for studying the trajectories of charged particles (from the Solar wind), for studying the Aurora Borealis phenomena (which could be used to Aurora Borealis hunting and predicting) and for applying the Aurora Borealis phenomena in graphical simulations (such as (space) rocket simulations, flight simulations and games).
