# Project 3

Simulation of Aurora Borealis

This program consists of three-parts:
- Particle movement simulation
- Particle absorption simulation
- Data analysis and data results

This project is the final project of Computational Physics which is a course given for the Master's Degree for Applied Physics at Delft University of Technology. Our final project is a physics-related problem; which can be used for studying the trajectories of charged particles (from the Solar wind), for studying the Aurora Borealis phenomena (which could be used to Aurora Borealis hunting and predicting) and for applying the Aurora Borealis phenomena in graphical simulations (such as (space) rocket simulations, flight simulations and games).

For the final project of Computational Physics we encourage you to define your
own project!

The only requirement we ask for is that it should be a simulation of a
physics-related project (but we consider physics-related rather broad, and e.g.
simulation of biological systems or an engineering problem are also absolutely
ok).
We do advise you though to start from a project where there is some existing literature.
in this way you have a starting point as well as something to compare your simulation to
for validation.

We encourage you to discuss your project idea with us during the time of class, 
or remotely via the planning issue #1. 

In any case, you need to fill in a short plan (a few lines) together with a
reference to literature in the planning issue, *and* have it agreed by us before
May 27 (i.e. latest two weeks before the presentation).

If you have problems to come up with a good project, we can provide you with
proven project ideas. But we first want you to try coming up with your own project!
Having designed your own project will also give a small bonus for the grade.
